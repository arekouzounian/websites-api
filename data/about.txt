Hello! My name is Arek and I'm a junior at USC. 

I'm majoring in Computer Science and, and I'm minoring in Cybersecurity. 

I started my journey into the world of coding through an extracurricular C# programming class on the weekends.

Over the years, I've learned more and more about the field, further deepening my passion and respect for the world of software.

When I'm not coding or learning about new technologies, I spend my time going to the gym, playing D&D, cooking, and exploring LA with my friends.
